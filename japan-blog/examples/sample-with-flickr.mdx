# Week One - Exploring Tokyo

What an incredible first week in Tokyo! From bustling street markets to serene temple grounds, every moment has been a discovery.

## Shibuya and Shinjuku Adventures

The energy in these districts is absolutely electric. The famous Shibuya crossing lived up to all expectations - watching thousands of people move in perfect choreographed chaos was mesmerizing.

I spent hours wandering through the backstreets of Shinjuku, discovering tiny restaurants and bars that could seat maybe 6 people maximum. The intimacy of these spaces creates such a unique dining experience.

## Culinary Discoveries

The food scene here is beyond anything I imagined. From the freshest sushi at Tsukiji to incredible ramen in hole-in-the-wall shops, every meal has been an adventure.

Some highlights:
- **Tsukiji Outer Market** - Fresh tuna that melted in my mouth
- **Ramen Yokocho** - Tiny alley with 6 different ramen shops
- **Convenience store onigiri** - Simple but perfect for breakfast on the go
- **Depachika** - Department store basement food courts are incredible

## What's Next

Next week I'm planning to explore more traditional areas like Asakusa and take a day trip to Kamakura. The contrast between ultra-modern Tokyo and traditional Japan is something I'm really excited to document.

Also want to try my hand at some cooking classes - there's something magical about learning to make the food you've been falling in love with eating.

## Practical Notes

- **JR Pass** - Absolutely worth it for the flexibility
- **Google Translate camera** - Lifesaver for menus
- **Cash** - Still very much a cash society, ATMs at 7-Eleven work with foreign cards
- **IC Card** - Suica makes train travel so much smoother

Already feeling like this is going to be a life-changing experience. Can't wait to see what week two brings!
