# Using Local Images in Your Journal

This is a quick example of how to include local images in your journal entries.

## Image from Public Directory

To display an image you've added to the `/public/images` directory, use this syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/your-image.jpg)
```

For example, if you've added a photo named `tokyo-skyline.jpg` to the public/images directory, you'd reference it like this:

![Tokyo Skyline](/images/tokyo-skyline.jpg)

## Organization Tips

For better organization as your journal grows:

1. Consider creating subdirectories for different locations or themes:
   - `/public/images/tokyo/`
   - `/public/images/kyoto/`
   - `/public/images/food/`

2. Use consistent naming patterns like:
   - Date-based: `2025-05-30-shinjuku-night.jpg`
   - Location-based: `tokyo-shinjuku-street.jpg`
   - Theme-based: `food-ramen-ichiran.jpg`

3. Optimize your images before uploading:
   - Resize large photos (1200-1600px width is usually sufficient)
   - Use JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
   - Consider image compression to keep your repo size manageable
