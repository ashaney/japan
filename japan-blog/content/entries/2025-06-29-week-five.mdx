Wow! There goes another week. It was mostly working and hanging out at the house, but there were a few highlights.

## Notable Events
On Thursday we had a small family gathering for my daughter's sixth birthday. On Friday we ventured out to the CostCo in Hyogo.

Saturday was the big event: a double birthday party at the Cinnamoroll Cafe in Shinsaibashi. We arrived and were taken to the third floor party room. Everything was cleaner and nicer than I expected. We ordered cakes, opened presents, and enjoyed the company of our friends. Afterwards we took the kids to the park and they ran around with 花火 (fireworks). All in all a really fun day.

On Sunday we were treated to a delicious private sushi lunch with family at Nigiru near Temma Station. It was most excellent.

## Upcoming Week
This will be our last week! I'll wrap up a couple things at work and start packing. On Thursday we'll head to Tokyo and meet up with a close buddy of mine before flying back on Friday. It's gone by super quick and it seems we get a little bit better (and hopefully a little wiser) when it comes to traveling each year.
