What a trip! Even though we were abroad for six weeks it felt like it went by in a flash. We had a lot of fun exploring Japan and making new memories.

## Notable Events
Nothing much happened this week. We spent most of our time relaxing and getting ready to come back home. The notable exception was a visit to Tokyo to visit my long-time friend. We visited Team Lab and ate yakiniku. It was a nice send off.

The stay in Tokyo was decent and we didn't have any delays or issues. Luckily we had a very logn layover in Houston, so we were able to go through the Global Entry application process and still had time to spare.

I got a stomach bug a couple days after we got back, but otherwise everyone was healthy and happy throughout the duration of the trip. We're already starting to make plans for next year. Stay tuned!
