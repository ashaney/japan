Time is flying by! Monday through Friday there wasn't a whole lot going on - shopping, eating delicious food, and working. The kids are adjusting to their schools quite well.

## Notable Events

On Sunday the 8th we met some American friends that moved over to Toyohashi for a couple of years. It had been a few months since they moved so it was great to see them. We ate [okonomiyaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okonomiyaki) and had a wonderful time catching up.

Friday the 13th (!!!) was also fun - Nao and I did karaoke in the evening and walked around the Namba area.

On Saturday we mostly took it easy, although I did take the family to a lovely little cafe nearby where we ate a proper American breakfast: pancakes, eggs, sausage and bacon. ðŸ˜‹

Sunday was a busy day! We left the apartment around 10 am and met up with our close Japanese friends. They have two little girls and we all went to an indoor play place in [Tennoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenn%C5%8Dji). After that we ate lunch and went to an indoor rock-climbing facility. They had some really crazy routes set up and everyone had a blast. Nao, the kids, and I had Father's Day dinner in Umeda that evening.

## Physical Activity
I averaged about 19,000 steps last week, and I managed to run 6.3 miles last week. Sunday the 15th I also spent about an hour rock climbing off and on (after running a couple miles that morning), so by the evening I was pretty wiped!

## Upcoming Week
I'm expecting a busier schedule at work on Tuesday and Wednesday. Then on Thursday the 19th, we're heading to Fukuoka! We've never been to this prefecture before, and we've got an exciting itinerary planned.
