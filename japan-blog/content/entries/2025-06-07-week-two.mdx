# Week Two in Japan

My second week in Japan has been filled with work routines, family time, and discovering local spots. Here's a daily account of the week's activities.

## Sunday, June 1, 2025

We shopped a little bit and went to "Animeal" with the kids. We got to interact with cats, dogs, ducks, rabbits, and a capybara.

## Monday, June 2, 2025

I went to the office in the morning and got everything set up at my desk. Around lunch time I went to Umeda with Nao and her mom. We met some of her mom's friends and looked at a neat exhibition area where they were selling handmade items. I bought a power strip from Yodobashi Camera and I also got some new shoes for the kids.

## Tuesday, June 3, 2025

I worked at the office then went to lunch with Nao and her mom. We ate at her mom's friend's sushi restaurant. He handcrafted the entire course for us and it was amazing as usual. After that I went back to the office for a while. We had a lot of extra laundry and also needed to wash our sheets so we went to the coin laundromat in the evening. We also ordered pizza for dinner.

I went to work and had curry with naan for lunch. My son went to a friend's house after school. In the evening, we went to the grocery store and then we went over to my brother-in-law's house, where the kids hung out with their cousins. We had homemade yakiniku for dinner.

I went to work and picked the kids up from school in the afternoon. For lunch I had a hawaiian-style burger. I got limited edition Pac-man doughnuts as a treat for everyone. In the evening we went to the supermarket and bought some sushi for dinner.
