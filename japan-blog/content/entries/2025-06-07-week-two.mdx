We shopped a little bit and went to "Animeal" with the kids. We got to interact with cats, dogs, ducks, rabbits, and a capybara.

I went to the office in the morning and got everything set up at my desk. Around lunch time I went to Umeda with Nao and her mom. We met some of her mom's friends and looked at a neat exhibition area where they were selling handmade items. I bought a power strip from Yodobashi Camera and I also got some new shoes for the kids.

I worked at the office then went to lunch with Nao and her mom. We ate at her mom's friend's sushi restaurant. He handcrafted the entire course for us and it was amazing as usual. After that I went back to the office for a while. We had a lot of extra laundry and also needed to wash our sheets so we went to the coin laundromat in the evening. We also ordered pizza for dinner.

I went to work and had curry with naan for lunch. My son went to a friend's house after school. In the evening, we went to the grocery store and then we went over to my brother-in-law's house, where the kids hung out with their cousins. We had homemade yakiniku for dinner.

## Saturday, June 7, 2025
We took it easy at home and just loafed around. Iâ€™m averaging about 15k steps and 6.30 miles per day. Next week I hope to run 2-3 miles at least 3 times in the morning before work/school.
